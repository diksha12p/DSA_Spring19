#This is a term paper titled "Fast Unfolding of Communities in Large Networks Using Louvain Community Detection Algorithm"

#Abstract: 

#Networks provide a convenient way to represent complex systems consisting interacting entities. 
Many networks contain “communities” of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. 
This term paper discusses a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. 
The method is a heuristic method which is based on 'Modularity Optimization'. 
The method is claimed to outperform majority of the other known community detection method in terms of computation time. 
Moreover, the overall quality of the detected communities is quite impressive, which is quantified by the 'modularity'. 
An interesting application of the same is based on identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of approximately 2.6 million customers. 
The application is also extended to ad-hoc modular networks.
